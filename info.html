      about the club: during the course of the club, we will be covering topics
      such as the mechanics behind stars, planets, black holes, galaxies & more,
      as well as having open discussions about information you will have learned
      after attending each meeting. we will also be watching videos about space
      to supplement information with cool visuals!!
