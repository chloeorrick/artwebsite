    <p>
      during the course of the club, we will be covering topics such as the
      mechanics behind stars, planets, black holes, galaxies & more, as well as
      having open discussions about information you will have learned after
      attending each meeting. the goal is to have as much fun as possible while
      learning a whole lot about space!!!! (:
